# Diabetes Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict diabetes progression based on various medical attributes. It uses the `scikit-learn` library and the `diabetes` dataset provided within `scikit-learn`.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following steps:
1. Loading the Diabetes dataset from `scikit-learn`.
2. Preprocessing the data and splitting it into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Training a linear regression model on the training data.
5. Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
